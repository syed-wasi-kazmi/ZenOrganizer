# ZenOrganizer

**ZenOrganizer – A free, open-source, and extremely lightweight file organizer for Windows and Linux.**

## Overview

Have you ever opened a folder and felt overwhelmed by the sheer mess of files scattered everywhere? Images, documents, videos, music, code files, and random downloads? That’s exactly the problem I faced in my daily life.  

ZenOrganizer was created to solve this mess. It automatically organizes your folders in **one simple step**, so you can focus on what matters instead of spending hours manually sorting files.

## How It Works

1. When you run the program, it asks you to **enter or paste the path of the folder** you want to organize.
2. ZenOrganizer scans all the files in that folder.  
4. Based on the file type, it automatically creates category folders like:  
   - `Images` → jpg, png, gif, etc.  
   - `Documents` → pdf, docx, txt, etc.  
   - `Videos` → mp4, mkv, avi, etc.  
   - `Audio` → mp3, wav, etc.  
   - `Code` → py, js, html, etc.  
   - And more…  
4. It **moves each file** into its corresponding folder, cleaning up your entire directory instantly.  

**Result:** Your messy folder becomes neatly organized in seconds, saving you time and mental stress.

## Why I Created ZenOrganizer

I created ZenOrganizer because I personally struggled with messy folders in my daily life. After building this tool for myself and seeing how useful it was, I decided to make it **available for everyone**. My goal is to develop more small, practical utilities that make daily tasks simpler and faster.
